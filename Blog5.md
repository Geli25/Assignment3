### Metrogram3D by Hiroshi Koi

I was very impressed by the creative coding work done by Hiroshi Koi. There are not much explanation on the work that he did, but it is a part of the [**Chrome experiment**](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome)collection. He created an interactive map for the subway in Tokyo. When you hover over any of the lines (the Tokyo lines are all color coded--he used the same colors), it will show the name of the metro line and if you hover over any of the stations it will show the station name on the side. There are dots moving along these lines, indicating the number of trains that are currently moving along this line and where they are at the moment. I believe that if you click on the dot (my computer was suffering because it was having trouble processing the project), the map will zoom to the dot and perspective will move along with the train. I think this is a very creative and aesthetically pleasing way of representing the map. It also presents potential of this real-time visual tracking of subway systems, which is promising.

### Wind of Boston by Refik Anadol

The designer of the famous infinity room Refik Anadol has created a **Wind of Boston** installation using data of the strength, direction, gust pattern and temperature of the wind of Boston. There are four "Chapters" featured in this artwork, highlighting differnt moments of the wind to deliver different interpretations and impressions of the city. For example, there is a chapter called **Sea Breeze**, which features wind from the ocean. Another chapter, **Gust in the City** features gusts of strong and speedy winds that occurred inside the urban environment, through the buildings. The moving installation and the ability to contain different narratives makes a true dynamic artwork with an impressive underlying meaning. I really like how Anadol chose to visualize something that we do not see with our naked eye and changed the data of that energy into a visual experience. It is truly impressive.
