# Museum Data As Art

[See the project in action](https://geli25.github.io/MuseumDataAsArt/)

I wanted to create an artwork that could potentially be exhibited in an art museum or gallery, but it is actually composed and determined by data. This is a glorified bar chart that indicates the number of visitors in El Pueblo museum in 2017, separated by month. The number of dots, the width and the height is determined by the amount of visitors. 
Slight interpolating animation is incorporated to give the data more life.
